# Euler problem 12: Highly Divisible Triangular Number

## Statement

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7$<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:
$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
| n | divisors |
|-|-|
| 1 | 1 |
| 3  | 1, 3 |
| 6  | 1, 2, 3, 6 |
| 10 | 1, 2, 5, 10 |
| 15 | 1, 3, 5, 15 |
| 21 | 1, 3, 7, 21 |
| 28 | 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 |

We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Reformulation 

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over $N$ divisors?

## Algorithm 

Let $\prod_i p_i^{e_i}$ be the prime factorization of a number $n$; the number
of multiples of $n$ is given by $\prod_i (1+e_i)$.

So, the algorithm is to compute the sequence of triangular numbers, and stop
when one finds such a number that has more than $N$ divisors using the formula 
above.
