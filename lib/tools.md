# Module: tools

This module implements generic functionalities that are not of mathematical
nature.

## Functionality overview

* `(merge-increasing ns ms)` merges the lists `ns` and `ms` of strictly
  increasing numbers. The result list is also strictly increasing. As a
  consequence, it contains only single instance of then numbers found in both
  lists.
* `(make-sequence-gen f a1 ... aN)` returns a generator for a sequence whose
  initial terms are the arguments `a1, a2, ..., aN`, and each subsequent term is
  obtained by applying the function `f` to the preceding N terms. For instance,
    * The naturals are generated by `(make-sequence-gen add1 1)`;
    * The Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 ... is generated by
      `(make-sequence-gen + 1 1)`.
* `(palindrome? ls)` is `#t` if the list `ls` is a palindrome.
